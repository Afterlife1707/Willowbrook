  shortName: A suburban town called Willowbrook
  description: Willowbrook is a once-peaceful suburban town now shrouded in an eerie
    darkness. Its streets, lined with small buildings and sparsely illuminated by
    street lamps, carry an unsettling quietness. The town's desolation is further
    intensified by recent mysterious deaths and strange supernatural occurrences,
    leaving it in a perpetual state of foreboding and fear.
